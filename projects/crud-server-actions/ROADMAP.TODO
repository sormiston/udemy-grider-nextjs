# TEST-DRIVEN REFACTOR OF CRUD FORM ACTIONS FOR CONSISTENCY
(See tag "server-side-validation-zod")

1. SnippetEditForm and its related server action updateSnippet, and...
2. NewSnippetPage and its related server action createSnippet...
3. ...are divergent in implementation pattern

Refactor SnippetEditForm / updateSnippet to agree with the established Create pattern
    - Zod validation
    - progressive enhancement enabled by form action prop
    - useActionState for server-client state maintenance during validation
    - error feedback UX

------
Establish TDD baseline:
    ☐ Write integration test to anchor current functionality (form submission + prisma client call)
    ☐ Augment integration test for new features (validation, error states)

Refactor:
    ☐ as above, mark when complete
